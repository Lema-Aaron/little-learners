be# little-learners
A web application platform where children explore various learning materials, get guidance from teachers and parents, attempt quizzes, earn points and badges.
This application is to make children's learning very easy in a way that they can study from home, at their convinient time and place rather than getting disturbed very early in the morning to go to school yet there is this solution of accessing everything at home over internet.
